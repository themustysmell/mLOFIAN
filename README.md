# mLOFIAN
## mTCP (http) LOg FIle ANalyzer

mLOFIAN is a program written in Quick Basic for analyzing the log files generated by HTTPSERV (*).

The results display the top 10 visited websites and the top 10 visitor IP addresses.

Additionally, details of the individual analysis steps can be displayed using the DEBUG=1 parameter.



**Usage:** mLOFIAN.exe LogFile [optional parameters]


LogFile      - The mTCP log file to be analyzed (must be specified)

_The following optional parameters are all set to 0 (off) by default_

<sub>DEBUG=[0|1]  - Messages are displayed during analysis (runtime benchmarks)</sub>

<sub>STATUS=[0|1] - A summary of the analysis is also displayed</sub>

<sub>NOKEY=[0|1]  - Do not wait for keyboard input. Suitable for batch processing</sub>


The program is currently not optimized for speed. This is due to the bubble sort algorithm used.

On an IBM PS/2 Model 30 with an 8086 CPU at 8MHz and 640kB RAM, the following benchmarks apply:

- 0.9kB can be processed per second
- 3 log entries can be processed per second
- 17 log lines can be processed per second

A 92kB log file has approximately 260 log entries and 1700 log lines. Total processing time approx 95s.


Tested so far with: 
- MS-DOS 5.0 and 6.22
- 8086 and 80286 CPUs
